### Part 2: Home Advantage Deconstructed

#### 1. Heatmap of Home vs Away Wins Per Team Per Season

```{r}
# Read and inspect data
bundesliga <- read.csv("bundesliga.csv")
names(bundesliga)

# Filter valid results
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>%
  filter(FTR %in% c("H", "A"))

# Compute wins per team, season, home/away
win_summary <- bundesliga %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(HOMETEAM, AWAYTEAM), names_to = "Loc", values_to = "Team") %>%
  mutate(Win = case_when(
    FTR == "H" & Loc == "HOMETEAM" ~ 1,
    FTR == "A" & Loc == "AWAYTEAM" ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>%
  group_by(SEASON, Team, Loc) %>%
  summarise(Wins = sum(Win, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Reshape for heatmap
win_wide <- win_summary %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Loc, values_from = Wins, values_fill = 0)

# Melt and plot
heat_data <- melt(win_wide, id.vars = c("SEASON", "Team"))

ggplot(heat_data, aes(x = SEASON, y = Team, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", high = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Wins by Team (Home vs Away)",
       x = "Season", y = "Team", fill = "Wins") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### 2. Point Differential Density: Home vs Away Win Difference

```{r}
# Calculate home - away win difference
point_diff <- win_wide %>%
  mutate(Diff = HOMETEAM - AWAYTEAM)

# Density plot
ggplot(point_diff, aes(x = Diff)) +
  geom_density(fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Density of Home vs Away Win Differences by Team",
    x = "Home - Away Win Difference",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
