### Load and Prepare Data

```{r}
# Load and clean the data
bundesliga <- read.csv("bundesliga.csv")
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>% clean_names()

# Check column names
names(bundesliga)
```

### 1. Season Trend: Average Goals per Match (Presentation Ready)

```{r}
# Create total goals per match and compute average per season
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>%
  mutate(total_goals = fthg + ftag)

season_avg <- bundesliga %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(avg_goals = mean(total_goals, na.rm = TRUE))

# Line chart showing season trend
ggplot(season_avg, aes(x = season, y = avg_goals, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "darkred") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Goals per Match by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Average Goals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. Top 5 Team Bar Chart (Optimized for Slides)

```{r}
# Total goals per team
team_totals <- bundesliga %>%
  group_by(hometeam) %>%
  summarise(home_goals = sum(fthg)) %>%
  rename(team = hometeam) %>%
  left_join(
    bundesliga %>%
      group_by(awayteam) %>%
      summarise(away_goals = sum(ftag)) %>%
      rename(team = awayteam),
    by = "team"
  ) %>%
  mutate(total_goals = home_goals + away_goals)

top_5 <- team_totals %>%
  arrange(desc(total_goals)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

# Presentation-style bar chart
ggplot(top_5, aes(x = reorder(team, total_goals), y = total_goals)) +
  geom_col(fill = "darkgreen") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 Teams by Total Goals",
    x = "Team",
    y = "Goals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 3. Annotated Scatter Plot: Home vs Away Goals

```{r}
# Scatter plot with annotation for linearity
ggplot(bundesliga, aes(x = fthg, y = ftag)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = 6, y = 5.5, label = "Line of Best Fit", hjust = 0, size = 4) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Home and Away Goals",
    x = "Home Goals",
    y = "Away Goals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
