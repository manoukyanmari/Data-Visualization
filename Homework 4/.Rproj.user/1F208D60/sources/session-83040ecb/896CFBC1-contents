### ðŸ§Š 1. Heatmap of Home vs Away Wins Per Team Per Season

```{r}
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>%
  filter(ftr %in% c("H", "A"))

win_summary <- bundesliga %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(hometeam, awayteam), names_to = "loc", values_to = "team") %>%
  mutate(win = case_when(
    ftr == "H" & loc == "hometeam" ~ 1,
    ftr == "A" & loc == "awayteam" ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>%
  group_by(season, team, loc) %>%
  summarise(wins = sum(win, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

win_wide <- win_summary %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = loc, values_from = wins, values_fill = 0)

heat_data <- melt(win_wide, id.vars = c("season", "team"))

### ðŸŸ£ 2. Density Plot of Home vs Away Win Difference

```{r}
point_diff <- win_wide %>%
  mutate(diff = hometeam - awayteam)
