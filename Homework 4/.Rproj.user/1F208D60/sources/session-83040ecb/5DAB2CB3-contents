```

### Load and Prepare Both Datasets

```{r}
# Load both Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 data
bundesliga <- read.csv("bundesliga.csv") %>% clean_names()
bundesliga2 <- read.csv("bundesliga2.csv") %>% clean_names()

# Add a league label
bundesliga$league_level <- "Bundesliga"
bundesliga2$league_level <- "Bundesliga 2"

# Combine the two datasets
combined <- bind_rows(bundesliga, bundesliga2)
```

### 1. Compare Average Goals per Match

```{r}
# Calculate total goals per match
combined <- combined %>%
  mutate(total_goals = fthg + ftag)

# Group by league and season for comparison
league_comparison <- combined %>%
  group_by(league_level, season) %>%
  summarise(avg_goals = mean(total_goals, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Line plot comparing goal averages
ggplot(league_comparison, aes(x = season, y = avg_goals, color = league_level, group = league_level)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Goals per Match: Bundesliga vs Bundesliga 2",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Average Goals",
    color = "League"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. Boxplot Comparison of Total Goals

```{r}
# Boxplot of total goals by league
ggplot(combined, aes(x = league_level, y = total_goals, fill = league_level)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Total Goals per Match by League",
    x = "League",
    y = "Total Goals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Bundesliga" = "darkblue", "Bundesliga 2" = "darkorange"))
```

### 3. Summary Table of Goal Statistics by League

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary_table <- combined %>%
  group_by(league_level) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_goals = mean(total_goals),
    median_goals = median(total_goals),
    sd_goals = sd(total_goals),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Display table
summary_table
```
