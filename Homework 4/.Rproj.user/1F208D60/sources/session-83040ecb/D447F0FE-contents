### Load and Inspect Data

```{r}
# Load the dataset
bundesliga <- read.csv("bundesliga.csv")

# Clean column names for easier handling
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>% clean_names()

# Print out the column names to verify them
names(bundesliga)
```

### 1. Heatmap of Home vs Away Wins Per Team Per Season

```{r}
# Filter only home or away wins (exclude draws)
bundesliga <- bundesliga %>%
  filter(ftr %in% c("H", "A"))

# Create long format to determine wins by team and match location
win_summary <- bundesliga %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(hometeam, awayteam), names_to = "loc", values_to = "team") %>%
  mutate(win = case_when(
    ftr == "H" & loc == "hometeam" ~ 1,
    ftr == "A" & loc == "awayteam" ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>%
  group_by(season, team, loc) %>%
  summarise(wins = sum(win, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Convert to wide format for heatmap plotting
win_wide <- win_summary %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = loc, values_from = wins, values_fill = 0)

# Melt the wide format for use in geom_tile heatmap
heat_data <- melt(win_wide, id.vars = c("season", "team"))

# Plot the heatmap using ggplot2
ggplot(heat_data, aes(x = season, y = team, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", high = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Wins by Team (Home vs Away)",
       x = "Season", y = "Team", fill = "Wins") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. Density Plot of Home vs Away Win Difference

```{r}
# Compute win difference for each team: home wins - away wins
point_diff <- win_wide %>%
  mutate(diff = hometeam - awayteam)

# Visualize the distribution of these differences
ggplot(point_diff, aes(x = diff)) +
  geom_density(fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Density of Home vs Away Win Differences by Team",
    x = "Home - Away Win Difference",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
